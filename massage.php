                    <p style="text-indent:2.5em;">The Traditional Thai Medicine curriculum offers courses in Thai
                        massage as follows:
                        <ol type="1">
                            <li>
                                <b> Thai Massage Courses: </b> study the history and evolution of Thai massage. There
                                are 2
                                types of Thai message: Chaloey Sak (independent massage) and Ratchasamnak (court
                                massage).
                                Students study the body’s ten major lines (Sen Pratan Sip), the disorders caused by
                                abnormalities in the body’s ten major lines and their treatment and rehabilitation by
                                Thai
                                massage. Students should also be able to evaluate patients’ symptoms so that they can
                                give them
                                a referral to doctors in modern medicine in a timely manner.
                            </li>
                            <li> <b> Thai Massage:</b> Students study massage therapy for partial paralysis, paralysis,
                                migraine,
                                sprained ankle, neck stiffness, Lom Plai Pattakat Sanyan 1, 3 Lang, Lom Plai Pattakat
                                Sanyan 4,
                                5 Lang and Jap Pong Haeng/Nam Kao, by means of Ratchasamnak massage (court massage). The
                                approach taken is a combination of theories from Thai traditional medicine and modern
                                medicine.
                                Students practice giving Thai massage to promote health according to the principles of
                                Thai
                                traditional medicine and the wisdom of Thai traditional doctors.</li>
                    </p>
                    </ol>

                    <p style="text-indent:2.5em;"> Apart from theory and practice sessions, students have to undertake
                        internships at community
                        hospitals nationwide in order to gain first-hand experience, acquire professional skills and
                        apply
                        the theory of examination and treatment in real situations.</p>
                    <p style="text-indent:2.5em;"> The key to the study of Thai massage is the weight of the hands or
                        fingers. Students have to
                        practice by crossing their legs, forming their fingers into a bowl shape and lifting themselves
                        up.
                        They learn and master this so that they can acquire quality hand or finger weight which will
                        lead to
                        quality treatment.</p><br>

                    <h5>Thai midwifery</h5>
                    <p style="text-indent:2.5em;"><strong> “Thai midwifery refers to the examination, care, counseling
                            and the promotion of health in pregnant
                            women. It also includes the prevention of abnormality during pregnancy or delivery and the
                            rendering
                            of assistance in childbirth by means of Thai traditional medicine </strong> (according to
                        the Practice of the Art of Healing Unit). In the Thai traditional medicine curriculum, students
                        study both the theory of Thai midwifery and modern midwifery, in the hope that students will be
                        able to work effectively with professionals from other fields. The courses students take are as
                        follows:
                    </p>
                    <p style="text-indent:2.5em;"><b> 1. Thai Midwifery </b> Students are taught to understand
                        childbirth and the importance of Thai midwifery and the Thai culture of postpartum lying-in by
                        fire. They also study the anatomy of men and women of child-bearing age, conception, pregnancy
                        and the process of assisting childbirth in normal labor.</p>
                    <p style="text-indent:2.5em;"> <b> 2. Thai Midwifery </b> Students learn the Mother and Child
                        Scripture which covers normal and abnormal symptoms during pregnancy. At the end of their
                        studies, students should be able to connect Thai midwifery theory and modern midwifery.</p>
                    <p style="text-indent:2.5em;"> Thai midwifery students also have to undertake internships at
                        community hospitals so that they can practice the whole process, beginning with prenatal health
                        care. Students have to be able to perform obstetrical examinations, evaluate the age of the
                        foetus and determine the delivery date. During childbirth assistance, students have to examine
                        or treat patients by means of Thai traditional medicine. On the point of delivery, students also
                        have to assist pregnant women in normal labor and care for their infants. They should also be
                        able to provide post-partum treatment if any abnormality occurs or provide post-partum care,
                        such as applying compresses to the breast in case milk is scarce or mothers cannot breastfeed,
                        or giving basic post-partum leg and back massage. Students should be able to explain the
                        principles and benefits of Thai postpartum lying-in by fire which includes massage, herbal
                        compresses, sitting above charcoal, herbal saunas, herbal bathing, heated salt-filled pot
                        compresses and abdominal wrapping. They should also be able to correctly and appropriately
                        advise mothers on postpartum self-care.</p>
                    <p style="text-indent:2.5em;"> Thai massage is part of the national wisdom of the Thai people and
                        has been passed on and accepted from the past to the present. Thai massage can be employed as a
                        treatment and it is regarded as being beneficial for both health and beauty. Compression and
                        touching can increase blood circulation, resulting in muscle relaxation, the loosening of
                        stiffness and the refreshing and relaxation of the mind.
