                <p align="justify" style="text-indent:2.5em;">On August 8, 2013, the PSU Faculty of Traditional Thai
                    Medicine, Miss Rattanavilai Thawornsuwon ,
                    an International Affair Officer and Miss Supannika Jaisaman, Traditional Thai Medicine Doctor,
                    expressed their warmth and hospitality to a group of students
                    and staff from Jiangxi University of Science and Technology (JUST), P.R. China, who paid a visit to
                    PSU during their study trip under the MOU between our universities.
                    The Chinese guests experienced making Thai herbal scrub. During their workshop, it was very nice to
                    have junior and senior Traditional Thai Medicine students participating in the activity.
                    Our guests were excited to make their own Thai herbal scrub. Also, at the end of the activity, both
                    Thai and Chinese students had a chance to sing the Prince of Songkla University song.
                    It was very nice for Thai students to teach Chinese students sing the University theme song. The
                    students enjoyed very much taking part in the activities.
                    These activities were a great opportunity for both Thai and Chineseâ€™s students to exchange and learn
                    together.
