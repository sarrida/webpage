                    <p style="text-indent:2.5em;">Thai Traditional Medicine has coexisted with Thai society for
                        centuries.
                        According to
                        the
                        history of
                        Thailand, there was some evidence appearing in the era of Sukhothai Kingdom that this kind of
                        medicine
                        was founded on practical experiences in Thai’s knowledge and wisdom accumulated and transferred
                        through
                        the ages. Although Thai Traditional Medicine has been neglected and replaced by conventional
                        medicine,
                        it has not totally forgotten by the Thai society since Thai Traditional Medicine is needed for
                        curing
                        diseases and maintaining good health. In addition, the study and techniques of Thai traditional
                        Medicine
                        was individually transferred by practitioners, through private organizations and in associations
                        or
                        groups involved with Thai Traditional Medicine and Thai pharmacy. </p>
                    <p style="text-indent:2.5em;"> Prince of Songkla University (PSU), a leading university in the South
                        of Thailand,
                        has a
                        resolution
                        to be a supporter of the society. Furthermore, PSU recognizes the importance of playing active
                        role
                        in Thai Traditional Medicine instruction for higher education in order to preserve, study,
                        research,
                        and develop its benefits to the society and the nation. The curriculum of Thai Traditional
                        Medicine
                        was thus incorporated into PSU development plan (No.9) and initiated in order to set up the
                        Bachelor
                        Degree of Science program in Thai Traditional Medicine.

                    <h2 class="h4">Significance</h2>

                    <p style="text-indent:2.5em;"> Thai Traditional Medicine is one of aspect of medical sciences that
                        support, prevent, cure, and rehabilitate health by means of homeostasis. Thai Traditional
                        Medicine also emphasizes on holistic health care in terms of the combination of body, mind and
                        society; hence, Thai Traditional Medicine is different from conventional medicine. For the
                        aforementioned reasons, more people opt for Thai Traditional Medicine as a method of health
                        care. Additionally, Thai Traditional Medicine is a reservoir of accumulated wisdom since the
                        ancient time. However, scientific and academic evidences are inadequate to support the acclaimed
                        wisdom.
